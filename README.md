# Heat-Exchanger



## One - Dimensional Parallel Flow Heat Exchanger Analysis

### Abstract

1. We seek to model the Heat exchanger set up and obtain Governing Equations for this process.
2. We now use the corresponding governing equations and set up Boundary Conditions and obtain a proper Boundary Value Problem.
3. Perform a Case study and model the setup to the BVP above.
4. Use Finite Element Method or Finite Difference Method and find out the unknown Temperature Distribution and solve for the unknown.
5. Find out Other physical Quantities related to the Problem.

To run the Program, open [Setup_Exchanger.m](https://github.com/VeerendraH/Heat-Exchanger-/blob/master/Basic/Setup_Heat_Exchanger.m) and input the physical variables and conditions.
Once you are done with that, proceed to run [Heat_Exchanger.m](https://github.com/VeerendraH/Heat-Exchanger-/blob/master/Basic/Heat_Exchanger.m)
